# rpi-node-temperature-ws
A simple webserver/websocketserver for displaying live temperature sensor readings from i2c sensor:DS18B20 on rasberry pi

Also includes (but not implemented completely) the framework for displaying and controlling GPIO as toggle switches - the intention is to display temperature (i2c) as well as switch on and off heaters using other GPIO pins
